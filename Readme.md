## Model Function

### 1 Build a new prediction model using mGPS

- Function description  
  This model can use the mGPS tool to build a microbial source prediction model based on the microbial abundance data uploaded by the user. To learn more about mGPS, please visit: [mGPS](https://github.com/eelhaik/mGPS)  

- Usage    
  
  - A. **In left side bar**:
  
  - Select ```Prediction program``` as `Build a new prediction model using mGPS`  
  
  - ```Input file(s)```: Upload data file(s) (in .csv format) containing microbial abundance data and metadata.   
    In metadata, at least one locality (eg. continent, city) and coordinates (necessary) data columns should be included. The metadata and abundance data of the sample can be merged into one file ( `Merged metadata and abundance data` ), or uploaded as two files ( `Separate metadata and abundance data` )   
    When `Separate metadata and abundance file` is selected. `Merge column name in metadata/abundance file`: Input the header name of column which is the merged column in two files.    
  
  - ```Enter the main locality level``` -  Input the main locality target. It should same as that column header. (eg. city)  
  
  - ```Enter the locality hierarchy``` -  The locality chain used in mGPS to construct the prediction model (same column headers). It should contain one or two locality information, latitude and longitude. Use ',' as separator. (eg. continent,city,latitude,longitude)
  
  - ```Column range of abundance data``` -  the number of columns in the file for the column containing abundance data. Use ':' as separator (eg 44:1000)    
  
  - ```Locality sample size cut off``` -  *(Optional)* Remove locality whose sample size is less than a certain value. If checked, input the cut off number (eg. 8)  
  
  - ``` Remove values``` -  *(Optional)* Remove some special values in column such as control samples. If checked, input column name(s) and corresponding value(s). (format eg. city:control,neg_control,pos_control;control_type:ctrl cities,negative_control,positive_control)   
  
  - ```Subsets in feature elimination```: *(Optional)* Set the size of subsets used in feature elimination (find the optimal subset size of microbiome features). If checked, input the subsets size with separator as ',' (eg. 50,100,200,300)

- Result plot and output  
  
  - ```Result Plot``` tab:  
    Show the accuracy of the prediction model trained by the mGPS tool and based on the reference microbial database uploaded by the user.  
    The original database will be divided into 5 folds, and mGPS will use 4 of these folds to train the model, and the resulting model will be used to predict the microbial source of the remaining fold. Iteratively obtain the prediction result of the original database and compare it with the actual location of the microorganism.    
    
    - *World map*: Samples' prediction origins are plotted on the world map  
    - *Accuracy bar plot*: model built by mGPS accuracy per site for the original reference dataset. mGPS accuracy is shown per-site as the distances between the predicted and true sampling site for the reference samples. The average prediction accuracy across all samples with each population given equal weight is shown on the left.   
  
  - ```Output``` tab:
