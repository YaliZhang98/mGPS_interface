## Model Function

### 1 Build a new prediction model using mGPS

- Function description  
  This model can use the mGPS tool to build a microbial source prediction model based on the microbial abundance data uploaded by the user. To learn more about mGPS, please visit: [mGPS](https://github.com/eelhaik/mGPS)  

- Usage    
  
  - A. **In left side bar**:
  
  - Select ```Prediction program``` as `Build a new prediction model using mGPS`  
  
  - ```Input file(s)```: Upload data file(s) (in .csv format) containing microbial abundance data and metadata.   
    In metadata, at least one locality (eg. continent, city) and coordinates (necessary) data columns should be included. The metadata and abundance data of the sample can be merged into one file ( `Merged metadata and abundance data` ), or uploaded as two files ( `Separate metadata and abundance data` )   
    When `Separate metadata and abundance file` is selected. `Merge column name in metadata/abundance file`: Input the header name of column which is the merged column in two files.    
  
  - ```Enter the main locality level``` -  Input the main locality target. It should same as that column header. (eg. city)  
  
  - ```Enter the locality hierarchy``` -  The locality chain used in mGPS to construct the prediction model (same column headers). It should contain one or two locality information, latitude and longitude. Use ',' as separator. (eg. continent,city,latitude,longitude)
  
  - ```Column range of abundance data``` -  the number of columns in the file for the column containing abundance data. Use ':' as separator (eg 44:1000)    
  
  - ```Locality sample size cut off``` -  *(Optional)* Remove locality whose sample size is less than a certain value. If checked, input the cut off number (eg. 8)  
  
  - ```Subsets in feature elimination```: *(Optional)* Limit the number of features to a certain value. If unchecked, mGPS will find the optimal subset size of microbiome features. If checked, there are three types of input format: a.input the subsets size with separator as ',' (eg. 50,100,200,300); b. input the subsets size range with separator as '-' (eg. 50-300); c. input a single value.  
       Hint: In addition to checking the given subset sizes, the algorithm also tries to use all features(taxa) to predict the origin. If the accuracy of the subset sizes uploaded by the user is lower than the accuracy of using all features, the algorithm will still choose to use all features for prediction to improve the accuracy. If the user still wants to use a specific number of features, the feature columns in the input file can be manually filtered according to the order of importance of the features in the output file "*Optimal_features.csv*" (Download optimal features in prediction model).
  
  - **B. In `Result Plot` tab**:    
  
  - ```Change longitude/latitude range in output map``` *(Optional)*  
  
  - ```Whether pull points to land/marine```: *(Optional)* If checked, predicted origin location will be pull to the nearest land/marine if predicted coordinates are out of the expected boarder.   
  
  - **C. Start the program:** Click the ```Start``` bar and then click the ```Result Plot``` tab   
  
  - **D.Data processing:** Please wait while output files are being generated. When the prompt bar disappears you can see the results and download files.  


- Result plot and output  
  For more explanation of output results, view the tutorial file "*mGPS Interface Tutorial.pdf*"  
  
  - ```Result Plot``` tab:  
    Show the accuracy of the prediction model trained by the mGPS tool and based on the reference microbial database uploaded by the user.  
    The original database will be divided into 5 folds, and mGPS will use 4 of these folds to train the model, and the resulting model will be used to predict the microbial source of the remaining fold. Iteratively obtain the prediction result of the original database and compare it with the actual location of the microorganism.    
    
    - *World map*: Samples' prediction origins are plotted on the world map  
    - *Accuracy bar plot*: model built by mGPS accuracy per site for the original reference dataset. mGPS accuracy is shown per-site as the distances between the predicted and true sampling site for the reference samples. The average prediction accuracy across all samples with each population given equal weight is shown on the left.   
  
  - ```Output``` tab:  
    The results of using the constructed prediction model to predict the source coordinates of the original dataset samples. In addition, the constructed prediction model can be downloaded (In Rda format).  
    
    - ```Download prediction data``` -  The prediction results of using the constructed prediction model to predict the source coordinates of the original dataset samples  
    - ```Download optimal features in prediction model``` -  The optimal features used in prediction model construction.  
    - ```Download feature subsets accuracy in feature elimination``` -  The prediction accuracy for different size of feature subsets.  
    - ```DownloadModel``` -  The constructed prediction model (In Rda format). User can load this model into R to check the detailed model information through
